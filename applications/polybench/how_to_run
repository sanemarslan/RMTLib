Compile: 
	1. For original code:
	   $ make
	2. For RMT-enabled code:
	   $ make RMT_OPTION=rmt

How to run: 
	Most of the programs are running with only kernel name.

Example: 
	1. For running the original code:
	   ./correlation-orig > orig.out

	2. For running the RMT-enabled code:
	   ./correlation-rmt > rmt.out

Optionally, some applications require an output file (i.e., ludcmp, floyd-warshall, and jacobi-1d)
These can be runned with the following commands: 
	
Example: 
	1. For running the original code:
	   ./jacobi-1d-orig orig.out

	2. For running the RMT-enabled code:
	   ./jacobi-1d-rmt  rmt.out
