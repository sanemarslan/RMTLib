What is RMTLib
----------------------------------------

RMTLib is an application level partial redundant multithreading library to
enhance fault tolerance of C programs. The library will execute more critical 
functions (i.e, annotated by the programmer) of an application in redundant 
mode. The user should include our library first, then annotates the function, 
that will be executed redundantly, including its arguments, and the annotated 
function will be executed by three threads. All the parameters of the function
are replicated before redundant execution; similarly the output of each function 
is compared before the execution of the rest of the application. Triple Modular 
Redundancy (TMR) is used to correct the output of redundant threads. The corrected 
output is determined based on a majority voting for the results of three threads.

How to use RMTLib?
----------------------------------------

Our RMT library is located under include/ folder. The user should invoke activateRMT
function by indicating which function should be executed in redundant mode with its 
parameters. Example usage can be found under applications/ folder. We used 30 
applications of Polybench suite (applications/polybench) and 4 more HPC applications 
(i.e., DGEMM, SpMV, CG, and SS-CG) under applications/others folder.

There is a separate Makefile to compile each program and a how-to-run file for 
running the target program.
